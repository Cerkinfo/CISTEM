### Warning / Reminder

Please help us to keep the **campus clean** and ensure that you dispose of your garbage in the garbage cans provided and **sort it**.

Please *deposit your empty bottles* in the **large grey bins** placed in as *many strategic locations as possible*. They will be sent to our sorting center correctly and you will help us to return them to our service providers and help with recycling. And save our **volunteers the hassle of searching for them** in the buildings.

Thank you in advance for your help in this task! *A small gesture on your part has a big impact on our work* over the weekend. ❤️
